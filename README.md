# GE2E_Speaker_Verification
This is my 2018 summer intern in Lenovo Research, artificial intelligence lab. My main task was to do research on speaker verification. Motivated by Google GE2E speaker verification and Baidu Deep Speaker, I tried to implement both with our own dataset (voxceleb & nihaoxiaogua).

## Part1 GE2E

### nihaoxiaogua dataset

### voxceleb1 dataset

## Part2 Deep Speaker
